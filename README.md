**Title:** AI Research Agent and Report Generator

**Overview:**
This project implements an autonomous **AI Research Agent** built with **LangGraph** to streamline research workflows. The system automates literature review, data extraction, and structured report generation using LLM-powered reasoning and dynamic graph-based task orchestration.

**Core Features:**

* **Graph-driven workflow:** Uses LangGraph to define modular, interdependent research tasks.
* **Information retrieval:** Queries multiple online sources, APIs, or local corpora for research data.
* **Summarization and synthesis:** Produces concise, citation-ready summaries from retrieved content.
* **Automated reporting:** Generates formatted research reports in Markdown, PDF, or DOCX.
* **Extensibility:** Easily customize graph nodes for different research domains or output formats.

**Architecture:**

1. **Input Layer:** Accepts a research query or topic.
2. **Graph Engine (LangGraph):** Manages the flow of subtasks such as searching, reading, summarizing, and drafting.
3. **LLM Agent Nodes:** Perform reasoning, evaluation, and content synthesis.
4. **Report Generator:** Aggregates node outputs into a final structured document.

**Usage:**

1. Define your LangGraph workflow (YAML or Python).
2. Set environment variables for API keys (e.g., OpenAI, SerpAPI).
3. Run the main script with a research topic as input.
4. Retrieve the auto-generated report from the output directory.

**Example:**

```bash
python run_agent.py --topic "Recent advances in graph-based LLM architectures"
```

**Output:**

* `/outputs/research_summary.md`
* `/outputs/research_report.pdf`

**Goal:**
Accelerate technical and academic research through modular automation, enabling rapid synthesis of reliable, structured insights.
